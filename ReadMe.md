# Lansweeper Things
by [James Schlackman](https://www.schlackman.org).

This is a collection of SQL reports and scripts for use with the [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/]) network inventory and asset management tool.

## Reports

SQL definitions intended for pasting into the custom report editor in Lansweeper. These are standalone query statements, not full scripts for creating views in the Lansweeper database.

## Scripts

A mixture of PowerShell scripts that leverage data from Lansweeper, and also cleanup SQL scripts for maintenance of the Lansweeper database itself. These can be run directly against **lansweeperdb** if you are using SQL Server as your back end, or executed using the **DatabaseMaintenance.exe** tool included with Lansweeper.
